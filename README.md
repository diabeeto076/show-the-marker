# Show The Marker

Show The Marker recolors low-level available quest icons on the world map and minimap.

## Features
- Recolors low-level available quest "!" icons (not turn-ins).
- Minimap pins respect the "Track Low Level Quests" toggle.
- Optional minimap edge tracking for entire-zone awareness.
- Color picker and slash command `/stm` to open settings.

## Dependencies (external)
Install these separately:
- HereBeDragons
- LibStub
- CallbackHandler-1.0

## Install
1. Place `ShowTheMarker` in your `Interface/AddOns` folder.
2. Install the dependencies listed above.
3. Launch the game and configure via `/stm`.

## Settings
- Color picker for the quest icon color
- "Track low-level quests for the entire zone" (minimap edge tracking)

## Notes
- World map recoloring applies to zone-level maps only.
- Minimap pins are custom and hide outside the minimap unless the setting is enabled.
